Go Run is a runtime library for managing the lifecycle of services. 

The world is filled with process managers, containers and the likes. Go Run takes us back to the source of truth. Back to the source. 
Go Run manages the lifecycle of a service from fetching the source, building a binary, to executing it. It's currently used 
by the [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) toolkit.
